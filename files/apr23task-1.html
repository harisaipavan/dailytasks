He is one of the highest-paid actors in Indian cinema[3][4] and has featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list since 2013. Charan is the recipient of several awards, including three Filmfare Awards and two Nandi Awards.
        Charan made his acting debut with the action film Chirutha (2007), a box office hit, winning the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut – South. He rose to prominence starring in S. S. Rajamouli's fantasy action film Magadheera (2009), the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time at the time of its release, winning the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. He went on to star in notable films such as Racha (2012), Naayak (2013), Yevadu (2014), Govindudu Andarivadele (2014), and Dhruva (2016).
        Charan achieved further commercial success with the blockbusters Rangasthalam (2018), winning his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu, and RRR (2022), which currently ranks as the third-highest-grossing Indian film of all time and his highest grosser. Charan emerged as a pan-Indian star with RRR and earned international recognition, including a nomination at the Critics' Choice Super Awards for Best Actor in an Action Movie.
        In 2016, Charan launched his own production house Konidela Production Company, which has notably backed Khaidi No. 150 (2017) and Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy (2019). Beyond his film career, he owns the polo team Hyderabad Polo and Riding Club and was a co-owner of the airline service TruJet. He is the son of actor Chiranjeevi.
        Early life and family Main article: Allu–Konidela family  Ram Charan was born in Madras (now Chennai) in a Telugu family to actor Chiranjeevi and his wife Surekha on 27 March 1985.[5][6] His family hails from Mogalthur and Palakollu in the West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh.[7][8] His maternal grandfather was the noted comic actor Allu Ramalingaiah.[9] He has two siblings — an older sister Sushmitha and younger sister Sreeja.[10] Ram Charan was educated at Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan, Chennai,[11] Lawrence School, Lovedale,[12] The Hyderabad Public School, Begumpet,[13] and at the St. Mary's College, Hyderabad.[14] He also attended Kishore Namit Kapoor's acting school in Mumbai.[15][16] He was presented with an honorary doctorate from Vels University, Chennai in April 2024.[17]
        
        Acting career
        2007–2009: Debut and breakthrough
        In 2007, Charan made his film debut as the leading actor in Chirutha, an action film directed by Puri Jagannadh which completed 50 days in 178 direct cinemas and 15 other shifted cinemas.[18] He played the role of Charan, an ex-convict seeking to kill his father's murderer. Rediff.com praised his performance, stating: "Ram Charan is quite promising. Dance and action appear to be forte. He is rather graceful in the dance numbers. He also stays clear of any oblique reference to his star father by way of dialogue or adopting any particular mannerism or style."[19] His performance in the film earned him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut – South and the Nandi Special Jury Award.[20][21]
        After the release of his second film, the fantasy film Magadheera (2009), Charan established himself as one of the leading contemporary actors in Tollywood. The film, in which he played dual roles, was directed by S. S. Rajamouli, and Charan's performance was critically acclaimed. The Times of India stated that "Ram Charan returns as a valiant soldier and breathes life into the larger-than-life role with ease. He showcases his horse-riding and dancing skills to perfection."[22] IndiaGlitz commented: "Charan has come up with a mature performance and he has carried the film very well. Both his characters were done justice, and he reminded of his father at many places."[23] Magadheera grossed over ₹150 crores worldwide and held the record of being the highest-grossing Telugu film until 2013 before it was surpassed by Attarintiki Daredi.[24] The film received six Filmfare Awards including two awards – Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and the Nandi Special Jury Award for Charan.[25]
        
        2010–2013: Career fluctuations
        Charan starred in Bommarillu Bhaskar's urban romance Orange in 2010 as Ram, a NRI living in Australia.[26] Although the film didn't perform well at the box office, critics praised the storyline and performance by Charan.[27] Jeevi of Idlebrain felt that Charan didn't try to stick to stardom and is not willing to repeat the mistakes performed by other stars.[28] Over the years, it became a cult film and received appreciation from the audience.[29] In her article for Film Companion, Alekhya Devarakonda compared his character to Howard Roark of 1943 novel The Fountainhead.[30] Following a year-long absence from the screen, he next appeared in Racha (2012), directed by Sampath Nandi. He played the role of "Betting Raj", a gambler. The film completed a 100-day run in 38 centres across Andhra Pradesh on 13 July 2012.[31] Racha's final share for its distributors was ₹45 crore (equivalent to ₹85 crore or US$11 million in 2023).[32] His performance in the film earned him acting nominations at the Filmfare and SIIMA award ceremonies.[33][34] Sify stated, "Both, actor Ram Charan and his director Sampath Nandi play a safe game by following the same pattern of earlier mass-masala movies."[35] Radhika Rajamani of Rediff criticised the plot of the film, but praised Charan's performance in action sequences and dance moves.[36] IndiaGlitz wrote: "He shows flashes of Chiru-ness more than he ever did in the past; be it his baritone or demeanor, he is a megastar in effect. Helped by a strong script, he could have been much better."[37] The film was released on 5 April 2012 and was declared a commercial success.[38]
        Charan with Priyanka Chopra during promotions of their film Zanjeer in 2013
        Charan had two films released in 2013. His first release was Naayak, directed by V. V. Vinayak, in which he played a dual role, once again after Magadheera. Writing to The Times of India, Karthik Pasupulate wrote that "Ram Charan did a great job, though there was no variation shown between the two characters."[39] It opened to mixed critical reviews and became a commercial success.[40] The film brought him two nominations – the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and the SIIMA Award for Best Actor (Telugu), once again, with a Best Actor award at TSR – TV9 National Film Awards.[41] The same year he made his Hindi cinema debut alongside Priyanka Chopra in the Telugu-Hindi bilingual film Zanjeer, a remake of the 1973 film of the same name.[42][43] He played the role of ACP Vijay Khanna who swears vengeance on his parents' killer. Charan made his debut as a playback singer with the song "Mumbai Ke Hero", composed by Chirrantan Bhatt, from the album Thoofan, the Telugu version of Zanjeer.[44] Rediff called it as "an unforgivably bad remake."[45] Film critic Rajeev Masand criticised his performance writing that he "comes off as stiff as a wax statue in his Bollywood debut, with barely any emotion, forget brooding anger."[46] Amid huge expectations, the film became a box-office bomb.[47][48]
        
        2014–2015: Continued career
        The following year saw Charan with two releases. Yevadu (2014), directed by Vamsi Paidipally is the third film in which he played the dual role, one who has received a face transplant of the other and becomes the target of underworld gangs because of the mistaken identity. The Central Board of Film Certification gave the film an 'A' certificate because of its violent action sequences.[49] Bangalore Mirror wrote that "For Ram Charan, Yevadu is essential to establish his status after Thoofan tanked at the box office. His character has two shades, and he tries his best to bring variations. He dances like there is no tomorrow and the choreography is a delight to watch."[50] A critic of Sify compared Charan's performance to his earlier films – Nayak and Thoofan and commented that he has done a fairly good job here.[51] Y. Sunita Chowdhary of The Hindu felt that Charan did well in the dance sequences than his acting in the role.[52] 
        His second release of the same year was the family drama Govindudu Andarivadele.[53] The film features him as a NRI from the United Kingdom.[54] The film opened to mostly positive reviews from critics,[55] and grossed over ₹40 crore (equivalent to ₹64 crore or US$8.0 million in 2023) at the box office.[56] Sangeetha Devi Dundoo commented that he has given his best performance after Magadheera.[57] Similarly Suresh Kaviyarani of the Deccan Chronicle too praised him and cited Charan's performance as "good" and "subtle".[58]</p>
